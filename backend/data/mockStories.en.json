While other bots were happy doing the same tasks every day, Bit wanted to create new things.\n\nOne day, a big bug appeared in the main server! No one knew what to do. The bug was eating all the data. Bit remembered a special code he practiced. With a deep breath (or a fan spin), Bit typed the code. *Zap!* The bug was fixed! The server was safe, and Bit became the hero of the digital world.",
